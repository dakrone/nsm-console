# Emerging Treats VOIP rules. 
#
# SID's are 2000000+ to avoid conflicts
#
# Only basic testing has been done. At this point all we guarantee is that they won't crash a recent snort release.

# Please submit any custom rules or ideas to emerging@emergingthreats.net or the emerging-sigs mailing list
